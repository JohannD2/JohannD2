My name is Johann Darbas from France. Accomplished sales manager with excellent planning and problem-solving abilities, I spent more than a decade in China working in sales, business development and marketing.

Reassigned at home due to the Covid19 epidemic early 2020, I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. I, then, grew a passion for coding and the web. Later, I expanded my knowledge by learning Node, React, Next and getting familiar with the MERN stack.
